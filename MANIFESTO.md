# Manifesto
As Hitta.se's development team, we believe in:

1. **Testing matters**
   - Testing early and often exponentially decreases the amount of rework as compared to trying to find and fix bugs later in any lifecycle.
   - We always dedicate time to expand our automated test suites by building both unit and end-to-end tests.
2. **Quality above all**
   - Quality takes priority over features and time.
   - Quality has many facets, such as security, performance and even a great user experience.
3. **No islands**
   - We collaborate on design and specs.
   - We make sure knowledge is shared.
   - We continuously review our code
   - We commit and push frequently.
   - We give honest feedback.
   - Processes are a means to help individuals and interactions.
   - Learn from others and help others learn from you.
4. **Coding is an art**
   - Designing solutions for the right scale.
   - Don't over-architect.
   - Aim for simplicity, honor KISS principle.
   - Design patterns are inspirations, not solutions.
   - You code for people, not machines.
   - Using a data driven approach to solve problems, e.g. use of profiling tools and other collected data points.
   - Leaving code better than you found it.
   - Aggregate data at or close to the source - transfer as little as possible.
   - Keeping number of dependencies at a minimum.
   - Be pragmatic, not a perfectionist.
   - Hone your craft and reserve time for deliberate practice.
   - Try things out but don't follow every trend.
5. **Automation is essential**
   - Manual steps are the bane of rapid and reliable delivery.
   - We should automate everything we can from tests to builds to deployements to anything else done manually today.
   - Code we write in the morning may be in production by the afternoon.
6. **Have fun, be proud**
   - Having a common goal.
   - Master your tools.
   - Remain a beginner, remain a learner.
   - Work doesn't always have to be fun, but you should derive some satisfaction from it be proud of how far you have come.
